###Code of conduct 
Meeting times:

Monday - 10:30 UK Time

Tuesday -  10:30 UK Time

All team members are expected to attend every meeting. Meeting are held every Monday and Tuesday and have a duration of 2 hours. Meetings can be extended depending on the workload and the availability of group members. Meeting outside of meeting times is allowed but must be communicated to other team members to avoid disarray in code modification carried out in the additional meeting outside of meeting times. 

In the case where a team member cannot bring himself to the current meeting, he is required to give solid reasoning as to why he is not able to attend. If a team member does not have a reason to attend a meeting and is simply lazy, he will be labeled as a **slacker** for the next 1 hour in the following group meeting. If a team member has been absent for more than 3 group meetings, he will be tied to a tree and showered with cinnamon for 10 minutes so he understands the kind of **slacker** he is.

Support must be given out to anyone confused or behind on what's happening in the group meeting or anything that he might have missed or might not been a part of.
